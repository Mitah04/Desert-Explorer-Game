# Desert-Explorer-Game
This project is a two-part implementation of "Desert Explorer," a terminal-based adventure game written in Haskell. The first part focused on core game mechanics. The second part added a GUI using the Gloss library , concurrent sand worms with software transactional memory (STM) , and save/load functionalities based on parser combinators.
